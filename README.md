# Image Captioning Server

This project provides a **containerized FastAPI server** for image captioning using the `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` model from Hugging Face. It leverages **NGINX, Gunicorn, and Uvicorn** to handle multiple parallel requests efficiently. A **Jupyter notebook** demonstrates sending parallel POST requests to the server.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- **app/main.py**: FastAPI application for loading the model and serving the `/caption` endpoint.  
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for building the container.  
- **nginx.conf**: NGINX configuration for reverse proxying to Gunicorn.  
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.  
- **demo_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for testing parallel requests.  
- **start.sh**: Entry script to start both NGINX and Gunicorn.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Docker  
- Python 3.10+ (for running the notebook)  
- Jupyter (for running the notebook)  
- Sample images (JPEG/PNG format) for testing  

---

## üöÄ Setup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Python Environment (Optional, for Notebook)
If you prefer to run the notebook in a local Python environment (rather than just Docker), you can create a virtual environment and install dependencies easily. 

### Option 1: Using uv (modern Python environment manager)

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment with uv
uv venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional dependencies for the notebook
uv pip install aiohttp jupyter
```

### Option 2: Using python -m venv (standard)
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional dependencies for the notebook
pip install aiohttp jupyter
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swaroski/image-captioning-server.git 
cd image-captioning-server
```

## Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t image-captioning-server .
```

## Run the Container
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 image-captioning-server
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:80


## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Python Environment (Optional, for Notebook)
### Using uv
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install aiohttp jupyter
```

### Or using venv
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install aiohttp jupyter
```

## üß™ Testing with the Notebook
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install aiohttp jupyter 
Prepare Sample Images
Place JPEG/PNG images (e.g., dog.png, family.png, surf.jpg) in an images/ directory or alongside the notebook.
```

### Run the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook demo_notebook.ipynb
```

Execute the cell to send parallel POST requests to http://localhost:80/caption.
The notebook will print captions for each image, e.g.:

```bash
Image: images/elephant.jpg, Caption: the elephant is wet
Image: images/bananas.jpg, Caption: a bunch of bananas
Image: images/spoons.jpg, Caption: a wooden table with a bunch of wooden spoons
Image: images/cycling.jpg, Caption: a man riding a bike
Image: images/cherry_blossom.jpg, Caption: people are gathered around a blue table covered in pink flowers
Image: images/dog.png, Caption: a dog sitting in the grass with its tongue out
Image: images/surf.jpg, Caption: a man riding a wave on a surfboard
Image: images/bike.jpg, Caption: a motorcycle parked in the dirt
Image: images/family.png, Caption: a group of people are smiling and posing for a picture
Image: images/boy_eating_burger.jpg, Caption: a boy eating a piece of pizza
```


## üñ•Ô∏è API Endpoint

```bash
POST /caption
```
- Request: Form-data with key file and an image (JPEG/PNG).

- Response: JSON with a caption field, e.g.:

```bash
{"caption": "A dog sitting in the grass with its tongue out"}
```

## üìù Notes
- The server uses 8 Gunicorn workers for concurrent request handling.

- The **Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base** model runs on GPU if available, otherwise CPU.

- Logs are available in /var/log/nginx/ inside the container for debugging.

- NGINX config allows uploads up to 10 MB (client_max_body_size).

üí° Model Choice
I chose the **Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base** model because:

‚úÖ It‚Äôs lightweight (~350MB) ‚Äî faster startup and efficient memory use.
‚úÖ Provides accurate image captions for a wide range of images.
‚úÖ Well-suited for a demonstration of containerized AI inference.
